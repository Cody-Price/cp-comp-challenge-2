This is my static comp 2.

I feel like I learned a lot from static comp 1 and tried to apply what i learned to this one. The issue I think you guys 
will stil notice is that i had to use text shadowing on my words due to a somewhat more complex background. I would have 
chosen a more simple background but I really wanted to stay true to the pokemon card theme.

I hope you enjoy!
